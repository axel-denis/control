## Who is it for
Use this module if you wishes to open your server to the web (access it via anywhere, with your domain name).

> [!TIP]
> This module is one of the more complex provided by this flake, as your network configuration can't be guessed and totally automatized by the flake alone.<br>
> If you only access your server from your local home network, you can leave this disabled.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We assume you already know basics about the subject (what is a domain name, a DNS, TLS/SSL...)

**Your local network (behind your router) will be referred to as LAN, and the world wide web ad WAN.**


## 1. Basics
In this first part, we will see how to edit default ports, then bind your webservices to your domain, to be able to use them using `appname.yourdomain.com`.

If you followed the [Getting Started](../getting_started.md) guide, you should be left with a config similar to this one. Please edit it like this to focus more on this guide's subject:
```nix
{ control, ... }
{
  control = {
    immich.enable = true;
    jellyfin.enable = true;
    psitransfer.enable = true;
    openspeedtest.enable = true;
  }
}
```

Right now, you can access services on your local network, by using `<server_ip>:<port>`. By example if your server's ip is `192.168.0.50`, you can access [openspeedtest](./openspeedtest.md) through `192.168.0.50:10006`. Default ports are defined in [the section "port" of the webservices docs](../web_options.md#serviceport).

If you want to set a custom port for an app, that's possible:
```nix
{ control, ... }
{
  control = {
    immich.enable = true;
    jellyfin.enable = true;
    psitransfer.enable = true;
    openspeedtest = {
        enable = true;
        port = 8080;
    };
  }
}
```

Let's now enable the router to bind everything to it's respective subdomain (don't rebuild it yet, you could get an error):
```nix
{ control, ... }
{
  control = {
    immich.enable = true;
    jellyfin.enable = true;
    psitransfer.enable = true;
    openspeedtest.enable = true;

    routing = {
      enable = true;
      domain = "yourdomain.com";
      letsencrypt = {
        enable = true;
        email = "email.for.letsencrypt@example.com";
      };
    };
  }
}
```
This configuration contains some new options, let's get through them.

- `domain` is self explanatory. All enabled apps will be binded to **appname.yourdomain.com.**

- `letsencrypt` enables https, getting certificates from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). Those certificates will be automatically managed (ACME). The email is an email where you could be contacted for informations relative to your certificate (never received one, but it's there).
  
  Will only work if your dns is already configured and ports 80 & 443 opened (we'll get to that bellow).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It's really recommanded for your server to use https, and Let's Encrypt ACME provides a nice, free and NixOS compliant way to do it. [Let's Encrypt ToS](https://letsencrypt.org/repository/) has to be accepted.<br>
> This flake does not provide a way to import custom certificates (if you already have some) for now. But that's should be some easy modifications if you want to contribute :smile:

> [!NOTE] 
> With router enabled, all usual containers ports are closed (you can't access by `<your_ip>:<port>` anymore). **Only ports 80 (http) and 443 (https) are opened.**

### To access your apps through your domain, you must do those steps:
1. Use your DNS provider to redirect your domain and each subdomain to your router ip.
2. Open your router port's$\color{red} *$ 80 and 443 -> *must be open at rebuild-time for the `letsencrypt` option to work.*
3. Rebuild (`sudo nixos-rebuild switch`)

> [!CAUTION]
> $\color{red} *$Important security note here. This guide assume you know the basics about opening a server to the web. If you don't, and are just following the steps of this guide, **please read more on the subject before opening anything.**

**Congrats!** Once you've done that, you can access your apps. In this case,
- [immich.yourdomain.com](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?si=HqmVdYb3yXppQw41)
- [jellyfin.yourdomain.com](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?si=HqmVdYb3yXppQw41)
- [psitransfer.yourdomain.com](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?si=HqmVdYb3yXppQw41)
- [openspeedtest.yourdomain.com](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?si=HqmVdYb3yXppQw41)

## 2. Customization
Now that we have a basic configuration of the routing module, let's see some customization:

### Subodmain customization

<details>
<summary>See more</summary>


```nix
{ control, ... }
{
  control = {
    immich = {
        enable = true;
        subdomain = "photos";
        port = 8081;
    };

    jellyfin.enable = true;
    psitransfer.enable = true;

    openspeedtest.enable = true;

    routing = {
      enable = true;
      domain = "yourdomain.com";
      letsencrypt = {
        enable = true;
        email = "email.for.letsencrypt@example.com";
      };
    };
  }
}
```

- `<module>.subdomain` -> changes the subdomain for this app.
- `<module>.port` -> Will use the specified port in the background, but keep in mind that, with this config, it's not directly accessible while the routing module is enabled.

</details>

### Keep LAN access

<details>
<summary>See more</summary>

```nix
{ control, ... }
{
  control = {
    immich = {
        enable = true;
        subdomain = "photos";
        port = 8081;
        forceLan = true; # <-
    };

    jellyfin.enable = true;
    psitransfer.enable = true;

    openspeedtest.enable = true;

    routing = {
      enable = true;
      domain = "yourdomain.com";
      letsencrypt = {
        enable = true;
        email = "email.for.letsencrypt@example.com";
      };
      lan = true; # <-
    };
  }
}
```

- `<module>.forceLan` -> Keeps LAN access enabled, even if the routing module is also enabled (does nothing if not) -> You will be able to access your module both with it's subdomain and it's port.
- `routing.lan` -> Keeps LAN enabled for every module. -> You will be able to access every module both with it's subdomain and it's port.

> [!TIP]
> It can be useful to access to your apps through your local network (<ip>:<port> instead of your domain name); As it can give a large network speed improvement. However this should not be the default, security wise.

</details>

## 3. Advanced security
We've seen the easier security option, that is tu use Let's Encrypt certs for https. However, this module also offer some more options:

### Checking client certificate
To protect your server against attacks, you can put it behind a proxy, another service that will filter requests from bots, other countries, etc... Giving something like this:

**Your server <- proxy <- client**

If the client uses your domain name (and your domain name points your proxy), no problem, it will go through the proxy before accessing your server. **However**, if the client knows your network ip, he can bypass your domain and access to your server using it's ip directly (bypassing the proxy). <br>
**Your server <- client | ~~proxy~~**

Thats why this flake has options to filter incoming requests, **ensuring only those comming from your proxy are accepted.**

```nix
{ control, ... }
{
  control = {
    immich.enable = true;
    jellyfin.enable = true;
    psitransfer.enable = true;
    openspeedtest.enable = true;

    routing = {
      enable = true;
      domain = "yourdomain.com";
      letsencrypt = {
        enable = true;
        email = "email.for.letsencrypt@example.com";
      };
      checkClientCertificate = true;
      clientCertificateFile = "/cert.pem"; # <- default to Cloudflare's
    };
  }
}
```

With this setup, only requests presenting the valid certificat (only your proxy) are accepted.

> [!TIP]
> **We support Cloudflare out of the box!**
>
> Cloudflare is a recognized DNS/Proxy provider enabling to easily create the setup just showed for free (once you have a domain):
> Cloudflare DNS -> Cloudflare Proxy -> Your server
> If `clientCertificateFile` is left undefined, it will use [Cloudflare Authenticated Origin Pulls CA](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/authenticated-origin-pull/) and should work out of the box if Cloudflare's Proxy is enabled for your domain and subdomains.
